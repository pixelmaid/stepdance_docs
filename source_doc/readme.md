## What is Stepdance?
Stepdance is a framework for creative motion control. Stepdance is:

- **Real-time**: Control motors with essentially zero latency using a variety of inputs such as potentiometers and encoders.
- **Modular**: Stepdance programs can be composed of software modules, and physical stepdance boards can be chained together.
- **Hybrid**: Blend real-time inputs and manipulation with traditional pre-planned approaches such as G-code.
